## Sarcopenia Detection Model

This repository contains code for building and evaluating machine learning models to detect sarcopenia based on various features. Sarcopenia is a condition characterized by loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, and it is associated with aging and certain chronic diseases.

### Data

The dataset used for training and testing the models contains information about various demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors, as well as medical history. Features include MMSE score, age, weight, height, waist and hip measurements, smoking history, presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia, hypertension (HT), and other variables.

### Preprocessing

Before training the models, the data undergoes preprocessing steps including:
- Handling missing values using the SimpleImputer class from scikit-learn
- Scaling numeric features using StandardScaler
- Encoding categorical features using OneHotEncoder
- Combining these preprocessing steps into a single pipeline using ColumnTransformer

### Models

#### Logistic Regression
The initial model tested is logistic regression, which is a linear classification algorithm. It's simple and interpretable, making it a good starting point for modeling.

#### XGBoost
XGBoost is an ensemble learning method that combines predictions from multiple decision trees. It often provides higher predictive accuracy compared to individual decision trees and is robust to overfitting.

#### Decision Tree
A decision tree is a simple, non-parametric model that predicts the value of a target variable based on the values of input features. It's easy to interpret and visualize, making it useful for understanding feature importance.

#### Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

#### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.

### Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insight into how well the models are performing in terms of correctly predicting sarcopenia cases.

### Feature Selection

Feature selection is performed using a greedy forward search method to identify the most important features for predicting sarcopenia. This helps in building more efficient and interpretable models.

### Model Deployment

Selected models are saved as pickle files for deployment in production environments. These models can be used to make predictions on new data, enabling early detection and intervention for sarcopenia.
